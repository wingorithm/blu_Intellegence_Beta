docs: Update README.md and remove unused images

## Documentation Update

### Description
This commit updates the README.md to reflect that the project is a sandbox for Next.js preparation, forked from ChatSDK. It also removes unused Open Graph and Twitter images.

### Changes
- Updated `README.md` with a new description.
- Deleted `app/(chat)/opengraph-image.png`.
- Deleted `app/(chat)/twitter-image.png`.

### Action Items for follow-up PR
- Verify all links in the new `README.md` are still valid.
- Consider adding a new, more relevant hero image or project logo to the `README.md`.
